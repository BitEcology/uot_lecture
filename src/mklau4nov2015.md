#Global Vision: Ecology from Naturalism to Beyond Modernism

- Define ecology
+ plant range map

* Me
** Ecologist: Studying how species interactions shape ecosystems
** Trees (Cottonwoods), Ants and Pitcher Plants
** California: Oaks, Redwoods and Dunes
** Arizona: Creosote and Pine
** Mass: Harvard Forest

### Naturalism and Life Zones

- Henry David Thoureau
- C. Hart Merriem
- Ecological Society of America Founded 1915
- Aldo Leopold

### Community Concept: Autecology and Synecology

- Autecology and Synecology
- Scales of ecological investigation
- Cowles
- Clements and Gleason
- The Dust-Bowl
- WWII, The Green Revolution (= Agricultural Concentration)
- Post-agrarian old fields (Earl Core) 
- The New Deal and the CCC and The Nature Conservancy

### Food Webs and the Ecosystem Concept
- The Atomic Age and Cold War Ecology = Radio Isotopes and Ecosystem Ecology
+ Hutchinson
+ HT Odum
- Island Biogeography: MacArthur, Wilson and Simberloff

### Diversity, Stability and Interactions

- Silent Spring, Rachel Carson
- Endangered Species Act, Clean Air and Water Acts and the EPA
- Invasive species and Ecosystem Meltdown
- Keystone species, Ecosystem Engineers and Foundation Species
+ Robert Paine: Keystones and Disturbance
+ Paul Dayton and Aaron Ellison
- Post-cold War: Microbes = Mycorrhizal Fungi and Foliar Endophytes

### Spatial-Landscape Ecology

- Roots in Biogeography
- Landscape Connectivity: Beier and Foreman
- Foreman: Landscape Ecology and Road Ecology
+ Pine Barrens: Ecosystem and Landscape
- GIS and Species Distribution Modeling

### Modern Challenges

- Climate Change = Sea level rise
+ http://sealevel.climatecentral.org/
+ Planting for the future? (Tom Whitham and Ruth Shaw)
- Urban and Agro-Ecology
+ Ecological Urbanism and Brown Fields
+ Biological Scaling (Brown and West)

### Perceptions: Human-Nature and Art

- Network ecology = Seeing the whole and the parts
- Modernism: rejecting natural humanity
- How do we perceive nature?
- Ecologists have excluded humans because humans do some crazy things.
- This dichotomy has lead to a challenge in ecology where ecology sets humans apart

- Quiz: What do you think?
- Two examples: Romantic vs Modern

### Q&A: Approaching complex issues of culture, design and ecology
