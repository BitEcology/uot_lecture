#Ecology and Landscapes in North America
* Landscapes: Perspectives

* Me
** What do you do? 
** Why do you do what you do?
** Where do you work?

* Define Ecology
** Study of the distribution and aubundance of organisms
** How an organism's environment determines its growth and survival

* C. Hart Merriem = Life zones
* Cowles, Clements and Gleason = succession/community concepts
** Disturbance
** Primary, secondary and climax
* Old fields = post-industrial, post-ww1ww2

* Eugene Odum = ecosystem development

* MacArthur and Wilson = 
** Modernization of ecology
** Island biogeography
** Diversity and Stability

* Environmentalism and Ecology
** WW II and the green revolution
** Rachel Carson = Silent Spring
** Environmental toxins
** Extinctions
** Simberloff = Non-native species invasions
** Paul Byer = Habitat fragmentation and loss
** Paul Ehrlich = The Population Bomb 

* Competition vs Mutualism = Complexity

* Modern Concepts of Landscapes
** Paine = keystone species
** Ecosystem Engineers
** Dayton and Ellison = Foundation species
** R.R. Forman = Humans in landscapes, urban
** E.O. Wilson = Sociobiology and Biophilia
** Brown, West = Biological Scaling and Cities
** Community Assembly
** State Space and the Cup and Ball Model
** Nancy Johnson = Mutualism vs Competition and the Continuum Concept

** Cities and climate change = cities and heat sinks

** Tom Whitham = Genetics of landscapes

** State Changes and Catastrophes

** Peter Del Tredici = native vs non-native? does it really matter

* Future
** Landscape concepts
** Cities
** Computation, information, crowds
